This is a brief description about how to use this performance test framework based on FIO.
For more info or feedback, please contact me.


1. The file "parameters" contains the common input parameters for all FIO tests. 
   Change this values according to your needs. 

   RUNTIME      Tell fio to terminate processing after the specified number
		of seconds. It can be quite hard to determine for how long
		a specified job will run, so this parameter is handy to
		cap the total runtime to a given time.

   NUMJOBS      Create the specified number of clones of this job. May be
		used to setup a larger number of threads/processes doing
		the same thing. Each thread is reported separately; to see
		statistics for all clones as a whole, use group_reporting in
		conjunction with new_group.

   IODEPTH      This defines how many io units to keep in flight against
		the file. The default is 1 for each file defined in this
		job, can be overridden with a larger value for higher
		concurrency. Note that increasing iodepth beyond 1 will not
		affect synchronous ioengines (except for small degress when
		verify_async is in use). Even async engines may impose OS
		restrictions causing the desired depth not to be achieved.
		This may happen on Linux when using libaio and not setting
		direct=1, since buffered IO is not async on that OS. Keep an
		eye on the IO depth distribution in the fio output to verify
		that the achieved depth is as expected. Default: 1.

   DEVICE       This is the block device where to run the test on


2. Run the tests. You have 2 options:
   2a. Run all the test by issuing 
          >> runAll.sh [time(sec)]
   2b. Run a specific test by issuing
          >> runtest.sh <test_number> [time(sec)]
          where <test_number> must be a number from 1 to 4, according to this list:
             1:reference 
             2:reallife 
             3:writeintensive 
             4:maxthroughput

          In both cases, if [time(sec)] is not specified, it will take the one from 
          the parameters file. If specified, it will overwrite that value. 

          The 4 default profiles defined are:

             [reference]
	     rw=randread 
	     bs=8k

 	     [reallife]
	     rw=randrw
	     rwmixread=65
	     bs=8k
	
	     [writeintensive]
	     rw=randwrite
	     bs=8k

	     [maxthroughput]
	     rw=read
	     bs=128k


3. When the tests are done, a .log file will be created containing the output of the 
   FIO command with the given profile. Also, the script provides an output on the 
   screen showing a summary of the results. 

4. Have fun!
